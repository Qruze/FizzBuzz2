# FizzBuzz2
Just Fizz Buzz

With a bit of manual error handling to assure that numbers are being entered. Otherwise terminate. 
The FizzBuzz logic is done in 1 line inside the for loop

1. Value is total number to count to. 
2. Value is the fizz value
3. Value is the buzz value

But seriously, if you can't figure it out on your own, there is not much I can do.
